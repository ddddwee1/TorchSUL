# HRNet 128 Patches

## Introduction

I have some ideas of cutting the whole image into smaller patches for a fine-grained bottom-up pose estimation. 

The network is trained based on 128 image resolution on COCO, and test is basically in a multi-resolution manner. 

I put my training and testing code here. Basically it is from Higher HRNet, but with slightly changes.
