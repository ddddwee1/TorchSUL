# TorchSUL

This package is created for better experience while using Pytorch. 

## Why making this

1. For fun.

2. Path-dependence. I am addicted to my own wrap-ups. 

3. Multi-platform. I have made the same APIs for pytorch, TF, MXNet, and a conversion tool to Caffe. 

## Installation

You need to install the newest version of pytorch.

Good, then just 

```
pip install --upgrade torchsul
```
